# About

Nikolas‘ photographic work oscillates between
editorial portraiture and conceptual approaches.
He studied photography at the University of Applied Sciences in Munich
after having had some excursions into stage design
and sculpting at Academy of Fine Arts.
Since 2013 Nikolas lives and works in Leipzig where he runs a provisional studio
and a workshop for restoring and building drum sets.
